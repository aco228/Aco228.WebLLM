It's designed to serve as a subagent that passes its findings to an oracle coding agent, who orchestrates/performs the rest of the coding task.To use relace-search you need to build an appropriate agent harness, and parse the response for relevant information to hand off to the oracle.

It introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), a fine-grained sparse attention mechanism designed to improve training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios while maintaining output quality. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)The model was trained under conditions aligned with V3.1-Terminus to enable direct comparison. Benchmarking shows performance roughly on par with V3.1 across reasoning, coding, and agentic tool-use tasks, with minor tradeoffs and gains depending on the domain. This release focuses on validating architectural optimizations for extended context lengths rather than advancing raw task accuracy, making it primarily a research-oriented model for exploring efficient transformer designs.",

It targets complex tasks across reasoning, code generation, knowledge QA, and multilingual use, while remaining robust on alignment and formatting. Compared with prior Qwen3 instruct variants, it focuses on higher throughput and stability on ultra-long inputs and multi-turn dialogues, making it well-suited for RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows that require consistent final answers rather than visible chain-of-thought.The model employs scaling-efficient training and decoding to improve parameter efficiency and inference speed, and has been validated on a broad set of public benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general assistant, code helper, and long-context task solver in production settings where deterministic, instruction-following outputs are preferred.",

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs.
